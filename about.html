					Hi, i'm Michl Hermann NDONG BIYOO but you can just call me Michel NDONG or just Michel.
				</p>
				<p class="m-5">
					I'm a graduate from the <a href="https://www.enspd-udo.cm"> National Polytechnic School Of Douala</a> in the Littoral region of
					<br />
					Cameroon and in that school, i've been learning software development, database management,
					<br />
					artifical intelligence, and so on and so on. After i graduate, i've worked as an intern in 
					<br />
					Two companies mainly as an IT Support and then after, i've begun a short formation at Orange
					<br />
					Cameroon in Cloud with AWS during that formation, i've also been scouted by BVMAC where i 
					<br />
					Work by the time i'm writing this website. 
				</p>
				<p class="m-5">
					After school, i didn't stop to learn in the computer science field and that mainly because
					<br />
					I want to find the place in the vast computer science where i am the most at ease and also,
					<br />
					Because to learn is the way of the human being.
					<br />
					I focus mainly on Cloud computing because i think it will be the thing of tomorrow, artificial
					<br />
					Intelligence because i don't want to be lag and because AI is what will support every technology
					<br />
					Like the Cloud, it will be something to know about for us technicians. Database because it is a 
					<br /> 
					Big part of my work at BVMAC and Finally technologies related to Fintech like Block chain, NFT,
					<br />
					And so on, because if you have searched a bit where i work, you will understand why.
